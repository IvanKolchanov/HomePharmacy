# HomePharmacy
The application was written as an MVP for a startup competition from the biggest Russian bank - Sberbank. The project got first place on the competition and went on to relise as a full application on a russian application store (the MVP was made 2 years ago and obviously everything was redesigned): https://apps.rustore.ru/app/ru.domapteka

("Дом аптека" translates to "House/Home Pharmacy", which is the name of the repository)

I am not credited as an official participant of the project on any websites as I was only connected to the project from the side, by my friends, ex-classmates and heads of the projects - Sophia and Maria Lubimovy.
